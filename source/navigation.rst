**Navigation**
===========

Here are some of the basic navigation tools that can be found on the website:

	- Home brings you back to a chart of all pool halls listed on the website. 
	- Players shows a list of all players registered on the website.
	- Halls shows a list of all pool halls listed.
	- Tournaments shows a list of all tournaments listed on the website.
	- Account shows your personal player information if you're logged in.
	- Account brings up login page if you're not logged in. 
		
Anything that is underlined on the website is also a link! If you come across a player you 
like and see that they're registered for a tournament coming up you can click on that 
tournament from the current page and you will be redirected to that tournament page.
